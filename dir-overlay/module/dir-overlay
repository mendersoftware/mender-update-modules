# Summary of module implementation
#
# NOTE! This module stores state in /var/lib/mender
#
# In ArtifactInstall state:
#
# If a manifest file exists, which means that there has been a previous
# successful deployment with this module:
#
#    1. Create a backup of current deployment, the manifest file
#       is parsed to determinate which files where installed on last successful
#       deployment.
#
#    2. The current deployment is removed from the system, the manifest file
#       is parsed to determinate which files where installed on last
#       successful deployment.
#
#    3. Mark the current manifest file as previous (manifest.prev), note at
#       this stage there is currently no active manifest. It can be restored
#       in two ways. Either a roll-back is performed or deployment in progress
#       finishes successfully.
#
#    4. Unpack/install content
#
# If manifest file does not exist, which means no previous deploy:
#
#      1. Unpack/install content
#
# In ArtifactCommit state:
#
# 1. Restore the "current manifest" file based on the manifest that is part of
#    the deployment
#
